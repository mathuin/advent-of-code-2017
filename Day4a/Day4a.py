# A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use
# a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a
# series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.
#
# To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.
#
# For example:
#
# aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
# aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
# aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
# The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How
# many passphrases are valid?
