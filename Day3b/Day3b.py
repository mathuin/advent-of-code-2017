# As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then
# store the value 1 in square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown
# above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including
# diagonals.
#
# So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:
#
#  - Square 1 starts with the value 1.
#  - Square 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it
#    also stores 1.
#  - Square 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum
#    of their values, 2.
#  - Square 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and
#    stores the sum of their values, 4.
#  - Square 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it
#    gets the value 5.
#
# Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first
# few squares would receive the following values:
#
# 147  142  133  122   59
# 304    5    4    2   57
# 330   10    1    1   54
# 351   11   23   25   26
# 362  747  806--->   ...
#
